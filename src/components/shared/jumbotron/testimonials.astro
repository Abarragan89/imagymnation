    review: "Great place to celebrate a birthday! There is a lot of space, a separate room with comfortable tables where you can accommodate many guests. A large gymnasium where children can burn off a lot of energy. The staff, these were two wonderful girls, they helped organize everything and played with the children. Many thanks to them! If you want to celebrate a birthday without fuss, then this is the place.",

    review: "My granddaughter has been going here for almost 3 years (since she was 6 mos). They offer a great free, weekly class for babies!! When she was old enough, she started with the mommy and me class and she has been going to weekly classes ever since. It is definitely the highlight of her week, every week",

    review: "Me and my 3 year old love coming here! We did try a class but he was too interested in running around, so we just come for open gym. The remodel is amazing with the little gym/ playground. I recommend getting passes and coming whenever you need a place for kiddo to burn energy!",
